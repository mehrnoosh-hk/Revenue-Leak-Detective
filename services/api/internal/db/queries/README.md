Hand written SQL queries for the Revenue Leak Detective project should be placed in this directory. Each query should be defined in its own `.sql` file, and the file name should reflect the purpose of the query.

For example:
- `find_revenue_leaks.sql`: A query to identify potential revenue leaks.
- `calculate_monthly_revenue.sql`: A query to calculate monthly revenue figures.

When adding new queries, please ensure that they are well-documented and include comments explaining the logic and purpose of the query.
