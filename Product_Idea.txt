<Idea>
An AI-powered agent that hunts down revenue leaks in SaaS (failed charges, paused subscriptions, coupon misuse, “trial forever” zombies, quiet churn signals). It doesn’t just surface leaks — it triages issues, suggests fixes, drafts customer outreach, and files tasks automatically.
</Idea>

<Target Users (ICP)>
SaaS companies (Series A–C, revenue ops teams, finance leads, SaaS founders).
</Target Users (ICP)>

<Pain>
Pain: lost revenue from unnoticed leaks + manual revenue recovery efforts.
</Pain>

<Problem & Pain Point>
Failed payments (most common, high ROI).
Unbilled usage.
Quiet churn (no logins + downgrades).
Coupon & discount misuse.
“Trial forever” zombie accounts.
</Problem & Pain Point>

<Value Proposition>
Differentiator: Not just dashboards → an agent that acts.
Flow: Detect → Suggest → Draft outreach/task → Human approves.
Integration-first: Stripe (v1), Slack + Linear (v1), later Chargebee/Recurly/Jira.
</Value Proposition>

<MVP Scope>
Start narrow → failed charges only (Stripe integration).
Agent alerts in Slack, suggests fix, drafts Linear task.
Human-in-the-loop: approve, deny, refine.
</MVP Scope>

<Stage & Goals>
Current: Prototype/MVP in development.
Next Milestones:
1.	MVP: Failed charges (Stripe integration) + Slack(Notifications) + Linear(Tasks).
2.	Expand: Add churn (no logins + downgrades) + coupon misuse + trial zombies.
3.	Growth: Multi-leak + multiple billing integrations.
</Stage & Goals>

<How It Works>
Detect → failed charge identified.
Suggest → retry payment or outreach.
Draft → email + Linear task created.
Human Approves → push to customer / task system.
</How It Works>

<Constraints>
Solo founder (lean build).
B2B SaaS-first.
Monetization path: tiered SaaS subscription.
