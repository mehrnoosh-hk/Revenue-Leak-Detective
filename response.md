Based on my analysis of the current project state and following the CTO prompt instructions, I'll now provide a comprehensive strategic development plan [[memory:7896378]] by proceeding step-by-step.

## Plan

### Strategic Development Plan for Revenue Leak Detective MVP

Based on the current state analysis, I'll guide you through the next critical development phase to transform your solid technical foundation into a market-ready MVP.

## Assumptions

**Product Stage Assessment:**
- **Current State**: Solid technical scaffolding with clean architecture (Go API + Python workers)
- **MVP Focus**: Failed charges detection and recovery (Stripe integration)
- **Target Market**: PLG B2B SaaS companies ($1-20M ARR) using Stripe
- **Go-to-Market**: Founder-led with design partner approach

**Technical Foundation Strength:**
- ✅ Excellent Clean Architecture implementation (8.5/10 rating)
- ✅ Production-ready backend infrastructure
- ✅ Proper database design with migrations
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and CI/CD setup
- ⚠️ Missing core business logic and integrations

## Highlight Implications

### Scalability
- **Strength**: Your clean architecture ensures easy feature expansion
- **Opportunity**: Repository pattern allows seamless integration additions
- **Risk**: Need to design integration abstraction layer before adding multiple billing providers

### Maintainability  
- **Strength**: Excellent separation of concerns and testing framework
- **Opportunity**: Well-structured codebase supports rapid iteration
- **Risk**: AI workflow complexity could create maintenance debt if not properly abstracted

### Velocity
- **Strength**: Solid foundation enables focus on business logic rather than infrastructure
- **Opportunity**: Can achieve MVP faster due to excellent technical base
- **Risk**: Integration complexity could slow initial market validation
